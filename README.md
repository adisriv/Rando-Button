## Rander (Random + Adder = Rander)

This iOS application is a game built on Xcode using Objective-C. The basic premise of the game is that there are 2 buttons which you must tap as fast as possible to add to your score (a random number is added) to reach your goal before time runs out (time resets every time you reach another level).

### Running the application

 1. Open the iOS folder in the Albums directory on Xcode and run it.
 4. If application doesn't work, just reload a few times.
